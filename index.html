          <h3>Valocity Core</h3>
          <p>
            This project involved developing a microservice application using ASP.NET Core and Angular for the front-end
            interface. The application was deployed on Azure, with user authentication capabilities. It incorporates
            role-based
            permissions for different users, allowing each to access specific features and functionalities.

            The application includes a custom dashboard and report generation functionality. It leverages Azure DevOps
            for
            continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), ensuring seamless updates and improvements.
            Notifications
            are sent to users based on actions they perform within the application, enhancing user engagement and
            interaction.

            For auditing purposes, extensive logging has been implemented. This project is primarily used by banking
            users,
            highlighting its robustness and security measures.

          <h3>MedInsight</h3>
          <p>
            This project revolves around a US healthcare application that was developed using WPF, C#, ASP.NET, and.NET
            Framework
            4.7. The application was later migrated to.NET Core 3.1. The project utilized TeamCity for CI/CD, which was
            later
            shifted to Azure DevOps. SQL Server was used for database management, along with Powershell for scripting.
            Other
            technologies used included Azure Batch, JSON, JavaScript, Python, Git, and SVN for version control.

            The application consists of several subprojects, such as BatchService, Waste Calculator, Guideline
            Analytics, HCG,
            Hayes Grouper, Evidence-Based Measure (EBM), and CCHG. Each of these subprojects was thoroughly integrated
            and tested
            to ensure seamless operation.
